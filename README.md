# TTIHP0p2 resubmission of tt07-raybox-zero

This project is made from a clone of the [ttihp-verilog-template](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttihp-verilog-template) repo.

It is a resubmission of [tt07-raybox-zero](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt07-raybox-zero) to the experimental Tiny Tapeout IHP 0.2 shuttle.

Note that this was already done by the Tiny Tapeout team as [TTIHP0p1](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-ihp-0p1). This is an attempt to do it more formally.
